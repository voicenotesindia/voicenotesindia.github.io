<p><strong>INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES</strong></p> <!-- This part need seem like it's not needed, but if you use any Google services, or any other third party libraries, chances are, you need this. -->
<p>We may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site or the App. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Site. They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content. Further, these advertisers may also serve ads to you on other websites (including ads for our products and services) based on information collected from you while using the Site. For example, we may use Google’s “remarketing” service to target our ads to you based on your prior use of the Site or the App when you visit on other sites in Google’s content network. You should be aware that advertisers may target advertisements to users based on certain user characteristics. If you respond to this type of targeted advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such ad servers, ad networks, or their advertiser clients.</p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISING AND REMARKETING</strong></p>
<p>[I|We] value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and [I|we] cannot
    guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p><strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
<p>The Site or App may contain links or references to external websites. These are provided for your convenience only, and we do not have control over the privacy or security practices and policies of third party sites. Any personal information you provide on linked pages is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Please learn about the privacy and security practices and policies of external websites before providing them with personal information.</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent. Any person who provides their personal information to us through the App represents that they are 13 years of age or older. We ask for or directly ascertain the age of the users from a login authentication service such as Google and store users’ age to ensure they are 13 or older, but do not share that information unless the user chooses to share it on the user’s profile. If you believe that there are any issues with this or the way the app collects information, please contact us immediately so that we may take appropriate steps to address the issue.</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION/strong></p>
<p>We take steps to help protect personal information. No company can fully prevent security risks, however. Mistakes may happen. Bad actors may defeat even the best safeguards..</p>

If you are accessing the Site or the App region with laws governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ, please note that you are transferring your personal data to a jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your home jurisdiction. By providing your personal data you consent to (a) our use of your personal data for the uses identified in this Privacy Policy, and (b) the transfer of your personal data to an alternate geographic location in the cloud.</p>

We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your going forward agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
